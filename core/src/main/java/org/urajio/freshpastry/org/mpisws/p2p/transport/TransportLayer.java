/**
 * The transport layer does provides the minimum functionality to provide communication
 * with flow control.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * The Identifier is the type of identifier this transport layer exports.  At the lowest level,
 * this is usually an InetSocketAddress, at the highest level, this is usually a NodeHandle.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * MessageType is the type of object this transport layer operates on.  At the lowest level, this is
 * usually a ByteBuffer, and at the highest level, a RawMessage.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * options are transport layer specific options that are passed through the transport layers.  If
 * a layer finds an option in the map that it understands, it applies the option.  For example,
 * whether to send the message as UDP/TCP or encrypted or not.  Thus, if you specify an option,
 * but do not use a transport layer that handles the option, it will be ignored.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * When a message is sent, or a socket is opened, each layer in the transport stack may add
 * a header.  For example, the magic number layer adds a special byte sequence to each outgoing
 * socket and message.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * When a message is read, or a socket is received, each layer will read only the header that it added.
 * For example, the magic number layer reads the bytes, to make sure that they match the expected byte
 * sequence.  If they don't match, or a timeout occurs before sufficient bytes are read, the socket
 * is closed, or the message is discarded.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * Once the header has been read, the transport layer calls callback.incomingSocket() or
 * callback.messageReceived().<br><br>
 * <p>
 * Sending a message and opening a socket may not be instant.  Since the message may be queued, you can include a
 * continuation (deliverAckToMe/deliverSocketToMe) to be called back when the operation succeeds or fails.  It
 * will be called back with the same RequestHandle that was returned when the call was made.  Note that if
 * the request fails immediately, the callback may be called before the method returns, thus you may not already
 * have a record of the RequestHandle.
 *
 * @param <Identifier>  The type of node this layer operates on.
 * @param <MessageType> The type of message this layer sends.
